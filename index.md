# About

Welcome to the AOSP Developers Community!

This website is a common hub for developers with a shared interest in
reducing code duplication in AOSP device HALs. Often we find that a lot of devices
contain very similar code, with minimal changes to support device specific
features.

We'd like to shift the focus of AOSP HAL development towards writing code which can
benefit the whole community, by focusing on upstream Linux APIs and generic
interfaces.

## Join in!

This is a community project, so if you're working on AOSP for a upstream focused board or device
we'd love to hear about it! You can come chat with us on IRC or matrix (see
links below), simply open a pull request to add your project to the links below
and we'd be happy to include it!

### Come chat with us

We have an IRC channel #aosp-developers @
[OFTC.net](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=%23aosp-developers)

You can also join via matrix using a client like

### Community Projects

Just so we can find each others work, here are links to various independent AOSP
focused efforts going on in the community.

[GloDroid](https://glodroid.github.io/) - AOSP environment utilizing upstream kerenl for OrangePi, PinePhone and RaspberryPi devices

[Generic sdm845 device project](https://github.com/aospm/android_device_generic_sdm845) - AOSP device directory to support a variety of sdm845 based devices (OnePlus6, PocoF1, etc)

[AOSP devboards](https://source.android.com/setup/build/devices) - Upstream AOSP supports a few devboards maintained collaboratively between Google, Linaro and Baylibre

### Generic HAL Efforts

[Force Feedback haptics hal](https://github.com/aospm/external_vibrator-ff) - A generic haptics HAL which supports drivers using the force feedback API via input class devices.

[drm_hwcomposer](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm-hwcomposer/drm-hwcomposer) - DRM/KMS based HWComposer implementation used on many devices

[tinyhal](https://github.com/CirrusLogic/tinyhal) - Generic Audio HAL on top of tinyalsa and tinycompress. Configured via XML.
