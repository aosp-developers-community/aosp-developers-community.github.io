## AOSP Developers Community

Welcome to the AOSP Developers Community!

We're just folks who are working with boards and devices against the AOSP project.

### Mailing list

Here is where we would [link](https://nowhere) to a mailing list if we had one.

### IRC

We have an IRC channel here @ somewhere on the somenet network

### Community Projects

Just so we can find each others work, here are links to various independent AOSP focused efforts going on in the community.
